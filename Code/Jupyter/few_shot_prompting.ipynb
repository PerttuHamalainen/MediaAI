        "\n",
        "Few-shot prompting means that one includes *high-quality examples* of desired outputs in the LLM prompt. This can greatly improve the generated results. Similar to explaining things to a human, using concrete examples is often the most *efficient and precise way* to explain what one wants.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Finding/writing the few-shot examples is a key skill to practise* in AI-assisted creative writing. Typically, this includes both writing example text yourself, and browsing and/or scraping the Internet for examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Learning goals:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Practice producing the few-shot examples and learn to anticipate how different examples change the results\n",
        "* Compare different LLMs and understand the differences between base models and finetuned models, as well as continuation models and chat models.\n",
        "* Practice visualizing and exploring a large number of generations using semantic embeddings. The same approach can be applied to exploring other text datasets such as customer support messages or social media posts.\n",
        "* Practice combinatorial few-shot prompting. For example, we will create game ideas that systematically explore combinations of game genres and mechanics\n",
        "\n",
        "**How to use:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Make sure you have an OpenAI account. You can create an OpenAI account for free at https://platform.openai.com/signup. The initial free quota you get with the account should be enough for the exercises of this notebook.\n",

        "* With davinci-002, reducing the temperature can help in balancing diversity and quality. The parameter controls how random the generation is. Temperature=1 is the default, where the model picks every next token randomly according to their probabilities. Temperature=0 means the model only picks the most probable tokens and disregards any alternatives.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why is davinci-002 less reliable but more diverse?**\n",

        "The davinci-002 is the so-called \"base\" OpenAI model trained on very large and diverse data. gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct has been finetuned to follow instructions, which tends to increase generation quality but reduce diversity and produce the recognizably boring voice of ChatGPT. Finetuning is typically formulated as an optimization problem for which the optimal solution is to always give the single best answer to a particular request or question. The finetuning datasets are also smaller, which inevitably limits diversity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key takeaway:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Different models have different strengths and weaknesses. If correctness is a priority - for example, in generating code - you typically need a finetuned model. But if the finetuned model's output is too boring or vanilla, it may be good to try the base model."
