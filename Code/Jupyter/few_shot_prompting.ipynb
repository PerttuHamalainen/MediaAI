        "*This Colab notebook is part of the [AI for media, art, and design](https://github.com/PerttuHamalainen/MediaAI) course of Aalto University*\n",
        "\n",
        "*To run the code and complete the exercises, you need an OpenAI account*\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates text generation using Few-Shot prompting and provides exercises to extend notebook. Solutions to the exercises are also provided, but the code is hidden by default.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What is Few-Shot prompting?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Few-shot prompting means that one includes *high-quality examples* of desired outputs in the LLM prompt. This can greatly improve the generated results.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Finding/writing the few-shot examples is a key skill to practise** in AI-assisted creative writing. Typically, this includes both writing example text yourself, and browsing and/or scraping the Internet for examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, we can prompt game ideas using the following prompt:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "A list of experimental indie game ideas:\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "An FPS game where time only moves when the player moves or performs actions. This allows Matrix-style slow-motion gun ballet, and transforms real-time action into a puzzle.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "A Sokoban-style game where the player pushes around blocks that are variables, operators, and definitions of a programming language. Blocks that connect to each other form statements that allow the player to define and alter the game's rules. For example, the player can connect \"floor\", \"is\", and \"lava\" to make the floor deadly.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Above, the few-shot examples describe the indie games Superhot and Baba Is You in a way that makes the core mechanics clear.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that this prompt is for LLMs that continue prompt (e.g., OpenAI's davinci-002 and gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct). For chat-based models like ChatGPT, you should change the first line to \"Please continue this list of experimental indie game ideas:\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**A few important things:**\n",
        "* When prompting lists such as game ideas, LLMs cannot distinguish between the prompt and previously generated items. In effect, *previously generated items become new few-shot examples.* This means that even one bad generation can throw the LLM off the rails and quality generally decreases with each item due to small random errors accumulating.\n",
        "* To prevent the above, it's better to prompt each item separately, making sure that the LLM only sees the original examples. Here, a bit of Python automation can greatly reduce the tedium, as demonstrated in this notebook.\n",
        "* Generated text quality typically improves with more examples, but going beyond 10 examples tends to provide diminishing gains.\n",
        "* The ability to generalize from the few-shot examples, a.k.a. *in-context learning*, only emerges in sufficiently large models and was demonstrated for the first time in OpenAI's largest GPT-3 variant (175 billion parameters).\n",
        "* If you cannot get good quality results and you can produce at least a few hundred examples, an alternative to few-shot prompting is finetuning an LLM, i.e., continuing to train some base LLM with your examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Learning goals:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Everyone: Practice producing the few-shot examples and learn to anticipate how different examples change the results\n",
        "* Those with at least some programming skills: Advanced few-shot prompting techniques such as combinatorial prompting and automatic filtering of the generated results.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How to use:**\n",
        "1. Select \"Save a copy in drive\" from the File menu to make a copy that you can edit in the exercises\n",
        "2. Select \"Run all\" from the Runtime menu. In the notebook cell below, enter your OpenAI API key when requested. If you don't have a key, follow [OpenAI's instructions](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key)\n",
        "3. Proceed through the notebook, following the exercise instructions.\n",

        "**New to Colab notebooks?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Colab notebooks are browser-based learning environments consisting of *cells* that include either text or code. The code is executed in a Google virtual machine instead of your own computer. You can run code cell-by-cell, and selecting \"Run all\" as instructed above is usually the first step to verify that everything works.

Finetuning is typically formulated as an optimization problem for which the optimal solution is to always give the single best answer to a particular request or question. The finetuning datasets are also smaller, which inevitably limits diversity."
