        "**What is Few-Shot prompting?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Few-shot prompting means that one includes *high-quality examples* of desired outputs in the LLM prompt. This can greatly improve the generated results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similar to explaining things to a human, using examples is often the most *efficient and precise way* to explain what one wants.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Finding/writing the few-shot examples is a key skill to practise** in AI-assisted creative writing. Typically, this includes both writing example text yourself, and browsing and/or scraping the Internet for examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, we can prompt game ideas using the following prompt:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "A list of experimental indie game ideas:\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "An FPS game where time only moves when the player moves or performs actions. This allows Matrix-style slow-motion gun ballet, and transforms real-time action into a puzzle.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "A Sokoban-style game where the player pushes around blocks that are variables, operators, and definitions of a programming language. Blocks that connect to each other form statements that allow the player to define and alter the game's rules. For example, the player can connect \"floor\", \"is\", and \"lava\" to make the floor deadly.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Above, the few-shot examples describe the indie games Superhot and Baba Is You in a way that makes the core mechanics clear.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that this prompt is for LLMs that continue prompt (e.g., OpenAI's davinci-002 and gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct). For chat-based models like ChatGPT, you should change the first line to \"Please continue this list of experimental indie game ideas:\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**A few important things:**\n",
        "* When prompting lists such as game ideas, LLMs cannot distinguish between the prompt and previously generated items. In effect, *previously generated items become new few-shot examples.* This means that even one bad generation can throw the LLM off the rails and quality generally decreases with each item due to small random errors accumulating.\n",
        "* To prevent the above, it's better to prompt each item separately, making sure that the LLM only sees the original examples. Here, a bit of Python automation can greatly reduce the tedium, as demonstrated in this notebook.\n",
        "* Generated text quality typically improves with more examples, but going beyond 10 examples tends to provide diminishing gains.\n",
        "* The ability to generalize from the few-shot examples, a.k.a. *in-context learning*, only emerges in sufficiently large models and was demonstrated for the first time in OpenAI's largest GPT-3 variant (175 billion parameters).\n",
        "* If you cannot get good quality results and you can produce at least a few hundred examples, an alternative to few-shot prompting is finetuning an LLM, i.e., continuing to train some base LLM with your examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What are semantic embeddings?**\n",
        "The remarkable abilities of LLMs are largely due to how they create internal representations or *embeddings* of each word or token. The embeddings are vectors (lists of coordinates) that define positions in a high-dimensional embedding space where *moving in a certain direction corresponds to changing the meaning* of the word. This allows an LLM to perform complex semantic manipulations and inferences using standard math, e.g., $king-man=queen-woman$ or, equivalenly, $queen=king-man+woman$.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook and in other applications such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), one computes such embedding vectors from whole sentences instead of single words or tokens. This allows plotting the sentences visually such that similar sentences form clusters. This can help one quickly notice and explore both main themes and rare outliers in some dataset of texts."

There are several genres\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof accessible roguelikes, so let's start with the first -\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edungeon crawling:  Every level of Naica is essentially a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edungeon, and it is definitely a roguelike. Naica's\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eprecursors are Mystery Dungeon, a turn-based dungeon\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecrawling series originally for the GameBoy Color, and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eZokobo, a free web-based and browser-enabled origin story of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eMoemon, a Pok\\u00e9mon parody life sim and roguelike. These two\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egames in combination inspired Akana, the current Naica.  In\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eAkana, I want to implement two things previously discussed.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThe first is the ability to use controllers with modifiers\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eto express keyboard shortcuts. Naica has a sizable audience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof players that naturally prefer using controllers to\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ekeyboards. Unfortunately, only a handful gesture-based\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eradiation making games on PC support physical controllers.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eSupporting a nonlinear subset of all keys is a bad deal. I\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewas thinking that in a game with limited screenspace, I\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecould display contextual shortcuts on the face buttons of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe controllers. For example, screen presses of standard\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eattack would open shortcuts for movement and environmental\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eactions; while in a cutscene, it would open contextual\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eshortcuts for the interactions available during that stage\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof the story.  The second thing is to use the initial draft\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof the terrain construction code for AwakenWorld and rewrite\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe core of Naica as a construction game. I think that a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebackground game about terrain construction could be very\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efun, and enable the player to access the capabilities that\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esurviving excavation or destroying enemy ammunition will\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eprovide. This could lead to a far more organic feel of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexploration and enhancement of the environment than the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elinear experience of making constructs, completing chores,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand getting smarter gadgets to clean up the mess.  If I\",\"A word puzzle game where every word is one of 32\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ehetereonyms: nouns that can be used as both objects and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003everbs. For example, if you build a bar, you can go drink at\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethat bar, or you can build a bar for someone else to use as\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea bar. You can rotate the word the way you can rotate an\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eactual puzzle, and the word can be interpreted differently\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efor different puzzles. For example, one player might have to\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edrink at a bar that makes them leave straight away.
